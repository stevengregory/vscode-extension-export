# VS Code Extension Export

A simple shell script that generates an install script for your VS Code extensions. Handy for backing up your extensions and quickly installing them on a new machine.

## Getting Started

Simply run the script in your terminal.

```bash
./vscode-extension-export.sh
```

This will produce a `vscode-extension-install.sh` file.
